# Regression Project - OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression
Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more difficult for your lungs to work properly. As pulmonary fibrosis worsens, you become progressively more short of breath.

## Task
The objective of this project is to predict a patient's severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. The idea is to predict the final FVC measurements for each patient.

## Structure

* The eda.ipynb is the analysis of the dataset. It's the first step I always do to be sure to understand my problem.
* The train.ipynb is the training of the model. It starts with an explanation of what I do during a training session, then trains a simple regression model on the dataset. The goal is not to make a state of art model but good enough to be used for a first use case.
