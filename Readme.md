# Regression Project - OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilities in machine learning and more specifically for a regression task that is important to me.

## Project
Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more difficult for your lungs to work properly. As pulmonary fibrosis worsens, you become progressively more short of breath.

## Task
The objective of this project is to predict a patient's severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. The idea is to predict the final three FVC measurements for each patient.

## Structure

* The eda.ipynb is the analysis of the dataset. It's the first step I always do to be sure to understand my problem.
